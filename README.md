# cryptarithmetic
A cryptarithmetic/cryptarithm solver written completly in Rust. The solver reads an equation that has its digits represented by letters and computes the letters using a simple DFS. This project was mainly created to help me learn Rust.

## To Dos:

 1. Add comments that integrate with rustdoc R
 2. Allow user to specify if they want output as dictionary (O: 8, D: 5, ...) or as filled equation (855+855) with flags or env vars
 3. Refactor code so that  each function only achieves a single purpose. (This could mean    creating other files) 
 4. Add CLI input for number of threads
 5. Threads should save vaild solutions instead of printing to screen
 6. Add unit tests
 7. Add support for other operations (^, !, %, etc.)

More to come in this README soon...
