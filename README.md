# cryptarithmetic
A cryptarithmetic/cryptarithm solver written completly in Rust. The solver reads an equation that has its digits represented by letters and computes the letters using a simple DFS. This project was mainly created to help me learn Rust.

##To Dos:
-Add comments that integrate with rustdoc
-Refactor code so that main each function only achieves a single purpose. (This could mean creating other files)
-Add support for multi threading
-Add unit tests
-Add support for other operations (^, !, %, etc.)


More to come in this README soon...
