# cryptarithmetic
A cryptarithmetic/cryptarithm solver written completly in Rust. The solver reads an equation that has its digits represented by letters and computes the letters using a simple DFS. This project was mainly created to help me learn Rust.

## To Dos:

 1. Add comments that integrate with rustdoc R
 2. Refactor code so that  each function only achieves a single purpose. (This could mean    creating other files) 
 3. Add support for multi threading
 4.  Add unit tests
 5. Add support for other operations (^, !, %, etc.)

More to come in this README soon...
